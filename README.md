## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

You will need to download the IPL dataset from Kaggle. You can find the data to download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/nowke9/ipldata). </br>

The dataset has 2 files: </br>
    1. matches.csv having every match detail from 2008 to 2019 and </br>
    2. deliveries.csv having ball by ball detail for every match.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. For this project, I was interested in using IPL dataset from 2008-2019 to better understand team statistics, venue statistics and winning statistics:

1. What is the probability of winning the game at a particular venue based on decision to field/bat first on winning the toss ?
2. Most dismissals by a wicketkeeper?
3. Does Home Ground Advantage has any effect on the result of the game ?
4. Different ML models to predict the winning team with features:
   - Team 1 Name
   - Team 2 Name
   - Venue
   - Toss Winner

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

**IPL_Predictive_Analytics.ipynb**: Notebook containing the data analysis and modelling. </br>
**matches.csv**: Details of every match from 2008-2019. </br>
**deliveries.csv**: Ball by ball details of every match from 2008-2019. </br>  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]().
